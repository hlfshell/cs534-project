# Utilizing Genetic Algorithms to Develop an Efficient Traffic Light Autonomous Agent

This repository contains all the code for a group project for WPI's CS534 Artificial Intelligence. In this project we tackled controlling the phase durations in lighted traffic junctions in a simulated city of Chicago. It utilizes SUMO, a standard traffic simulator, and TraCI, a python module for communicating and controlling SUMO.

To do this, we used genetic algorithms to train a series of agents, most of which utilized neural networks to control the timing durations of the lights.

A short video of the simulator being controlled by neural networks can be seen via `demo.mkv`, and the `final_paper.pdf` is the resulting paper for the project.
